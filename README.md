# Hill Climb Racing & Gymnasium Environment
This reinforcement learning environment enables users to train different agents using Gymnasium and various Stable-baselines3 algorithms; I initially utilized this environment for my bachelor's thesis.

The original source of the Hill Climb Racing game in JavaScript can be found here: https://github.com/Code-Bullet/Hill-Climb-Racing-AI by the Youtuber Code Bullet. It has been rewritten into Python with some minor tweaks, including full support for (previously OpenAI Gym) [Farama Gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium) and [Stable-baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3).
