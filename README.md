# Hill Climb Racing & Gymnasium Environment for thesis

The original source of the Hill Climb Racing clone game in JavaScript can be found here: https://github.com/Code-Bullet/Hill-Climb-Racing-AI by Code Bullet. It has been rewritten into Python with some small tweaks, including full support for (previously OpenAI Gym) [Farama Gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium) and [Stable-baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3). This version contains all experiments of the thesis and all the datasets, models and graphs including the code.
